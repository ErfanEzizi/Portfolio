Hi, welcome to my cs50-web development-final project: My portfolio.

for my last project i did lots of research and learned a lot.
Home page of the site contains four parts:

路Base introduction.

路About me/work field.

路Past projects

路Contact.


First two part is mostly HTML/CSS and Js.

You could click on the three colored circles to jump to three diffrent sections of the website.
And click"Contact" to the bottom to send email to me.
By clicking on the social media icons to see my corresponding social media accounts.

On the "About me" section you could Download my CV( currently not uploaded).

For the "Past project" section i used POST method to update the posts in the future as a superuser(curently no other users can register),sqlite database for the Posts and Tags,
And a "Allposts" route to view all the post. By clicking on the post viewer will be taken to more detailed page about the post.
And every post has a Tag about the languege/framework i used to build the website. including CRUD functions.

On the "allposts" page, you can search the post by its name and tags.i also used django pagination.

For the last part "Contact", i used django.core.mail with smtp gmail letting viewrs to send email directly from the website(learned the methods from youtube).

After loged in as a superuser you could click "NEW POST" to create new past projects.

The reson why i choose to build a Portfolio is because i want to build something that i could use in the future. it may not include everything i've learned from this course such as(user authenticate, React) so on, but i'm pretty happy with my results. And it satisfies all requierd fetures of a Portfolio site. i will deploy the website in the short future.

Thank you for everything , i've learned so much from this course.
